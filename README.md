### 🎯 Objective:
In this data science project, we analyze the results of an A/B test conducted on an online educational platform that provides learning services and courses to students.  
The platform operates on a freemium model where users can access basic content for free but need to pay for premium courses and advanced features.  
Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new payment mechanism compared to the existing baseline, investigate statistical significance of observed differences.  
In addition, we provide data-driven recommendations for business implementation.
